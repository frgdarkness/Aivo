# UI First Enforcement Engine

## 🎯 Overview

This document defines the automated enforcement engine that ensures UI First methodology compliance throughout the development process.

## 🔴 Critical Enforcement Rules

### Auto-Blocking System

**Immediate Blocks**:
- ❌ **Logic Before UI**: Block any backend/logic implementation before UI completion
- ❌ **Incomplete CRUD UI**: Block feature development if CRUD UI is incomplete
- ❌ **Missing User Flow**: Block task creation without defined user flows
- ❌ **Untestable UI**: Block UI that cannot be properly tested

**Warning System**:
- ⚠️ **UI State Missing**: Warn when UI states are not fully defined
- ⚠️ **Navigation Gaps**: Warn about incomplete navigation flows
- ⚠️ **Design Inconsistency**: Warn about design system violations

### Enforcement Triggers

**Project Level Triggers**:
```markdown
TRIGGER: New project creation
ACTION: Force UI First workflow activation
VALIDATION: Ensure .project-identity has uiFirstValidation enabled

TRIGGER: Feature addition request
ACTION: Validate UI coverage before allowing implementation
VALIDATION: Check UI requirements, design, and tasks exist

TRIGGER: Task creation
ACTION: Enforce UI-first task prioritization
VALIDATION: Ensure UI tasks are scheduled before logic tasks
```

**File Level Triggers**:
```markdown
TRIGGER: Backend file modification
ACTION: Check if corresponding UI exists and is complete
VALIDATION: Validate UI coverage for affected features

TRIGGER: API endpoint creation
ACTION: Ensure UI exists to consume the endpoint
VALIDATION: Check UI screens that will use the API

TRIGGER: Database model changes
ACTION: Validate CRUD UI exists for the model
VALIDATION: Ensure all CRUD operations have UI representation
```

## 🤖 Automated Enforcement Actions

### Pre-Development Enforcement

**Requirements Phase**:
```bash
# Auto-check before allowing Design phase
✓ All features have UI requirements
✓ User flows documented with UI touchpoints
✓ CRUD operations mapped to UI screens
✓ UI states identified and documented
✓ Navigation structure planned

# Block transition if any check fails
BLOCK: "UI requirements incomplete. Please complete UI coverage before proceeding to Design phase."
```

**Design Phase**:
```bash
# Auto-check before allowing Tasks phase
✓ All UI screens designed (wireframes/mockups)
✓ UI design system established
✓ Responsive design considerations addressed
✓ Accessibility requirements included
✓ UI component library defined

# Block transition if any check fails
BLOCK: "UI design incomplete. Please complete all UI designs before proceeding to Tasks phase."
```

**Tasks Phase**:
```bash
# Auto-check before allowing Implementation
✓ UI implementation tasks prioritized first
✓ All UI screens have corresponding tasks
✓ UI integration tasks defined
✓ UI testing tasks included
✓ Backend logic tasks scheduled after UI

# Block transition if any check fails
BLOCK: "UI-first task prioritization not followed. Please reorganize tasks with UI first."
```

### During Development Enforcement

**Code Modification Checks**:
```bash
# Before allowing backend code changes
CHECK: Does corresponding UI exist?
CHECK: Is UI complete and tested?
CHECK: Are UI integration points defined?

# Block if checks fail
BLOCK: "Backend modification blocked. Complete corresponding UI first."
```

**Task Execution Checks**:
```bash
# Before starting any task
CHECK: Is this a UI task or does UI exist for this feature?
CHECK: Are prerequisite UI tasks completed?
CHECK: Is task sequence following UI-first order?

# Block if checks fail
BLOCK: "Task execution blocked. Complete UI tasks first."
```

## 🔍 Validation Engine

### File Structure Validation

**Required Files Check**:
```bash
# Check for UI First compliance files
REQUIRED: Requirements.md (with UI First sections)
REQUIRED: Design.md (with complete UI designs)
REQUIRED: Tasks.md (with UI-first prioritization)
REQUIRED: ui-first-validation-checklist.md (completed)

# Auto-create missing files with templates
ACTION: Create missing files from UI First templates
```

**Content Validation**:
```bash
# Validate Requirements.md
CHECK: UI First Analysis Checklist completed
CHECK: All main screens documented
CHECK: All secondary screens documented
CHECK: CRUD UI specifications complete
CHECK: User flows with UI touchpoints defined

# Validate Design.md
CHECK: Screen-by-screen UI designs complete
CHECK: CRUD operations UI designed
CHECK: Visual design system defined
CHECK: Responsive design strategy documented
CHECK: Accessibility design included

# Validate Tasks.md
CHECK: UI Implementation tasks listed first
CHECK: All UI screens have corresponding tasks
CHECK: UI Integration tasks defined
CHECK: Backend Logic tasks scheduled last
```

### Real-time Monitoring

**Development Progress Tracking**:
```bash
# Monitor task completion order
TRACK: UI tasks completion before logic tasks
TRACK: Feature UI coverage percentage
TRACK: CRUD UI implementation status
TRACK: User flow testing completion

# Alert on violations
ALERT: "Logic task started before UI completion"
ALERT: "Feature missing UI coverage"
ALERT: "CRUD operation without UI"
```

**Quality Gates**:
```bash
# Phase transition gates
GATE_1: Requirements → Design (UI coverage 100%)
GATE_2: Design → Tasks (UI designs 100%)
GATE_3: Tasks → Implementation (UI-first prioritization)
GATE_4: Implementation → Testing (UI completion before logic)

# Block progression if gates not met
```

## 🚨 Enforcement Actions

### Blocking Actions

**Hard Blocks** (Cannot proceed):
```bash
# Project level blocks
- New feature development without UI requirements
- Backend implementation before UI completion
- Task creation without UI-first prioritization
- Phase transition without meeting UI gates

# File level blocks
- Backend file modification without corresponding UI
- API creation without UI consumption plan
- Database changes without CRUD UI
```

**Soft Blocks** (Warning with override):
```bash
# Development level warnings
- UI state not fully defined (can proceed with warning)
- Navigation flow incomplete (can proceed with plan)
- Design system inconsistency (can proceed with fix plan)
```

### Corrective Actions

**Auto-Fix Actions**:
```bash
# Automatically fix common issues
- Create missing UI First template files
- Reorganize tasks to UI-first order
- Generate UI requirements from feature descriptions
- Create basic UI task structure
```

**Guided Fix Actions**:
```bash
# Provide step-by-step guidance
- Show missing UI requirements checklist
- Suggest UI screens needed for feature
- Recommend CRUD UI patterns
- Guide user flow design process
```
