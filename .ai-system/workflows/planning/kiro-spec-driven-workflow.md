# ðŸŽ¯ Kiro Spec-Driven Development Workflow

> **âš¡ Integrated Kiro task creation and execution workflow with UI First methodology**  
> Leverages Kiro's powerful spec-driven development for structured feature implementation with user interface priority

---

## ðŸŒŸ Workflow Overview

**Purpose**: Utilize Kiro's superior task creation capabilities while enabling execution across all IDEs with UI-first approach  
**Philosophy**: UI First â†’ Kiro creates â†’ Everyone executes  
**Integration**: Seamless handoff from UI-driven specs to IDE-specific implementation

### ðŸ”„ Four-Phase Process (Enhanced with UI First)

0. **ðŸŽ¨ UI First Analysis** - UI coverage validation for new projects (NEW)
1. **ðŸ“‹ Requirements Phase** - EARS format requirements with UI-centric user stories
2. **ðŸŽ¨ Design Phase** - UI-priority technical design with comprehensive research
3. **âœ… Tasks Phase** - UI-first actionable implementation checklist

---

## ðŸŽ¨ Phase 0: UI First Analysis (NEW PHASE)

### UI First Trigger Conditions
- New project without existing codebase (`projectStage: "stage1_brainstorm"`)
- User mentions "new app", "from scratch", "fresh project"
- No existing UI components detected in project structure
- Project identity indicates frontend/mobile application type

### UI First Validation Process

**Mandatory UI Coverage Requirements**:
- âœ… Every feature MUST have corresponding UI screen
- âœ… All CRUD operations MUST be accessible through user interface
- âœ… Complete user flows MUST be mapped to screen transitions
- âœ… No backend-only features allowed in initial implementation

**UI First Analysis Checklist**:
```markdown
## UI Coverage Analysis
- [ ] All user stories have corresponding UI screens
- [ ] Navigation flows connect all features
- [ ] CRUD operations accessible via interface
- [ ] Error states have UI representation
- [ ] Loading states properly handled
- [ ] User feedback mechanisms implemented
```

**Integration with Existing Workflow**:
- If UI First validation passes â†’ Proceed to Phase 1 (Requirements)
- If UI gaps identified â†’ Block progression until UI coverage complete
- Reference: `.ai-system/workflows/planning/ui-first-methodology.md`

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 1: Requirements Creation (Kiro) - Enhanced with UI Focus

### Trigger Conditions
- New feature development request
- Complex functionality requiring structured planning
- User mentions "spec", "requirements", or "detailed planning"
- Project stage requires formal documentation
- **NEW**: UI First validation completed successfully

### Kiro Requirements Process (UI-Enhanced)

**File Creation**: `.kiro/specs/{feature_name}/requirements.md`

**Enhanced Structure Requirements**:
- Introduction section summarizing the feature with UI context
- **UI Requirements Section** (NEW - Priority Section):
  - Screen-by-screen feature mapping
  - User flow documentation with UI transitions
  - UI component specifications and interactions
  - Responsive design requirements
- Hierarchical numbered list of functional requirements
- **UI-Centric User Stories**: "As a [role], I want to [UI_action] on [screen], so that [benefit]"
- EARS format acceptance criteria with UI validation:
  - WHEN/THEN structure: "WHEN [user_action_on_UI] THEN [system] SHALL [UI_response]"
  - IF/THEN structure: "IF [UI_condition] THEN [system] SHALL [UI_feedback]"
  - AND conditions for complex UI interactions

**UI-First Quality Standards**:
- Every requirement MUST reference corresponding UI element
- CRUD operations MUST specify UI access method
- User stories MUST include UI interaction details
- Consider mobile/web UI patterns and constraints
- Include accessibility and responsive design requirements
- Reference existing design system components

**Enhanced Approval Process**:
- Generate initial requirements with UI coverage analysis
- Validate UI completeness before presenting
- Present complete requirements document with UI mapping
- Request user approval: "Do the requirements and UI coverage look good?"
- Iterate based on feedback until explicit approval

  - User interaction patterns and gestures
  - Responsive design specifications
  - Platform-specific UI guidelines compliance
- **Overview**: High-level feature description with UI context
- **System Architecture**: Backend integration supporting UI requirements
- **Components and Interfaces**: UI components first, then API specifications

- Validate UI completeness before backend design approval
- Offer to return to requirements if UI gaps identified
- Iterate until explicit approval received

## âœ… Phase 3: Tasks Creation (Kiro) - UI First Task Prioritization

### Task Document Structure (UI-Priority)

**File Creation**: `.kiro/specs/{feature_name}/tasks.md`

**UI-First Format Requirements**:
- Numbered checkbox list with max 2 hierarchy levels
- Decimal notation for sub-tasks (1.1, 1.2, 2.1)
- **UI Implementation Priority**: UI tasks MUST come first
- Clear objective as task description with UI context
- Specific requirements references as sub-bullets
- Incremental build from UI to backend logic

### UI-First Task Content Standards

**Task Prioritization Order (MANDATORY)**:

**Priority 1: UI Implementation Tasks**
- Screen layouts and component creation
- Navigation and routing implementation
- User interaction handlers and form validation
- UI state management and data binding
- Error handling and loading states in UI
- Responsive design and accessibility features

**Priority 2: Integration Tasks**
- API integration with existing UI components
- Data flow between UI and backend services
- Real-time updates and synchronization
- Authentication and authorization UI flows

**Priority 3: Backend Logic Tasks**
- Business logic implementation
- Database operations and data persistence
- Background processing and scheduled tasks
- Performance optimization and caching

**Enhanced Task Types**:

**Allowed UI-First Task Types**:
- UI component implementation and styling
- User interaction and navigation logic
- Form validation and user feedback
- State management and data binding
- API integration with UI components
- Unit testing for UI components
- Integration testing for user workflows
- Configuration and environment setup

**Prohibited Task Types** (Unchanged):
- User acceptance testing or feedback gathering
- Production/staging deployment
- Performance metrics analysis
- End-to-end application testing
- User training or documentation
- Business process changes
- Marketing activities

**UI-First Quality Requirements**:
- Every UI screen MUST have corresponding implementation task
- All CRUD operations MUST have UI access tasks
- Navigation between screens MUST be explicitly tasked
- Error states and loading indicators MUST be implemented
- User feedback mechanisms MUST be included
- Responsive design MUST be addressed for each screen

**Enhanced Approval Process**:
- Present complete tasks document with UI-first ordering
- Validate UI task coverage for all requirements
- Request user approval: "Do the UI-first tasks look good?"
- Ensure UI implementation precedes backend logic
- Iterate based on feedback with UI priority maintained
- Stop workflow once UI-complete tasks approved

## ðŸ”„ Phase 4: Cross-IDE Task Execution - UI First Implementation

### UI-First Task Distribution Strategy

**Kiro Advantage**: Superior UI-first task creation and project planning  
**Other IDEs**: Optimized for UI implementation and backend integration

### Enhanced Execution Workflow

1. **UI-Priority Task Selection**: Choose UI tasks first, backend tasks second
2. **Context Loading**: Load requirements, UI-first design, and task context
3. **UI Implementation**: Execute UI tasks using IDE-specific strengths
4. **Backend Integration**: Implement supporting logic after UI completion
5. **Status Update**: Update task status in Kiro specs with UI validation
6. **Quality Check**: Verify UI functionality before backend integration

### UI-First IDE-Specific Task Routing

**Trae AI**: Complex UI workflows, multi-screen navigation, system integration  
**Cursor**: Rapid UI prototyping, component generation, styling implementation  
**Claude**: UI code analysis, accessibility optimization, responsive design  
**Qoder**: Quick UI fixes, simple component implementations, styling adjustments

### Enhanced Task Status Management

**UI-First Status Updates**:
- Update UI task to 'in_progress' before starting implementation
- Validate UI functionality before marking 'completed'
- Update backend task only after UI dependency satisfied
- Update parent task when all UI sub-tasks complete
- Use exact task text from tasks.md with UI validation notes

**UI-First Execution Constraints**:
- Implement UI functionality BEFORE backend logic
- Verify UI interactions against task requirements
- Test user workflows through UI before backend integration
- Stop after UI completion for user validation
- No automatic progression to backend tasks without UI approval
